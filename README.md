CSE-110 is the first course of my Bachelor's Degree in Software Development at Byu-Idaho.

In this course, I tried to learn more and more about Python. Each week we had to create a new program and improve our skills based on the content previously taught.

Initially, the projects were easier, but week after week the level of difficulty increased. In total, I completed 8 projects that are in this repository.

I know it's a long journey to become "Good", but I'm sure with effort and dedication I'll reach my goal.

I'm very grateful for this opportunity to improve my skills!
